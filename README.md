Lottery Game and tests

In this little project, I made a lottery system where you can choose the pool of numbers and the size of the array you create to see which numbers where drawn. Then you can make a bet, trying to guess the numbers.\
I compared various sorting methods (selectionSort, bubbleSort, mergeSort, linearSearch and binarySearch) to see which is better and in what circumstances. After the guess, the results are shown and you can choose to see the sorted array.

What you have to do to run it is download the code and compile it with gcc, then you can play it in the terminal.
