Lottery Game and algorithm tests

In this little project, I made a lottery system where you can choose the pool of numbers and the size of the array you create to see which numbers were drawn. Then you can make a bet, trying to guess the numbers.\
I compared various sorting methods (selectionSort, bubbleSort, mergeSort, linearSearch and binarySearch) to see which is better and in what circumstances. After the guess, the results are shown and you can choose to see the sorted array.

Just download the code and compile it with gcc, then you can run it in the terminal.
